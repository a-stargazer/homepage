								<h1>My Name is Alice Yang</h1>
								<p class="mb-4">I am an aspiring software engineer located in the San Francisco Bay Area. By day, I work in a library that allows me to combine my love for books and tea while sitting behind a computer. By night, I continue to sit behind a computer and attend a coding bootcamp called <a href="https://kickstartcoding.com/" target="_blank">Kickstart Coding</a>.<p>
								<p>I am expected to graduate as a full-stack software engineer in June 2020 and will be open to opportunities across the globe as I am always looking forward to my next adventure.</p>
